			<p><b>A’ingae Language Documentation Project</b> is an interdisciplinary effort which aims to document, investigate, and revitalize A’ingae (Cofán), a language isolate spoken by approximately 2,000 Cofán (A’i) people in the Amazonian region of Northeast Ecuador and Southern Colombia. The project is directed by Scott AnderBois (Brown University) and Wilson de Lima Silva (University of Arizona) and carried out in close collaboration with members of the Zábalo, Dureno, Dovuno, and Sinangoé communities in Ecuador.</p>



			<h3>The Cofán people</h3>

			<p>The Cofán people have long lived at the intersection of two distinct cultural and geographic regions: the Andes and Amazonia. While they presently live in what is now the province of Sucumbíos in northeast Ecuador and southern Colombia, they have historically made use of a much larger territory as a primarily hunter-gatherer people. Although their numbers have been greatly reduced since the arrival of Spanish in the 16th century—down at one point to 350 people from an estimated pre-colonial population of 15,000—the Cofán now are about 2,000 strong and growing, a success they often credit to social cohesion enabled by their distinct linguistic identity. New archeological findings casting light on their material culture, its geographical extent, and the diachronic changes thereof are still being made.</p>

			<p>Despite this, the Cofán currently face a variety of challenges to their traditional lands and ways of life. Since the discovery of large oil reserves in and around Cofán territories, oil exploration and drilling has caused substantial environmental damage. Beyond its direct impacts, the discovery has led to the construction of roads and an influx of colonists from other parts of Ecuador into the region and along with it new threats like mining, logging, and poaching.</p>

			<p>In response to these challenges, they took direct action and bravely campaigned for land rights, often achieving success unparalleled in the region. They championed the Cofán Ranger Park Guard Program, using Cofán people’s knowledge of the land to defend their territory, and launched the Charapa Turtle Project to study and manage river turtle population in order to preserve the diversity of the local fauna. In January 2019, the Cofán signed a binding agreement with the Ecuadorian government that gave them permanent control over 343,750 acres of Amazonian forests—an area larger than the United States’ Rocky Mountain National Park. In total, the Cofán are stewards of over 1 million acres of land, working to keep pristine an area of the Amazon basin roughly the size of the U.S. State of Delaware.</p>



			<h3>The A’ingae language</h3>

			<p>While the language has more commonly been referred to by the name “Cofán,” or occasionally “Kofán” in scholarly literature, “A’ingae” is the name speakers use for their language (<i>a’ingae</i> literally means “in the way of the A’i/people”). A’ingae is a language isolate, which means that it is believed to be unrelated to any other known language on earth. Despite having no genetic relationship to other languages, A'ingae has many typological features characteristic of other languages of the region, including SOV basic word order, nominal classifiers, presence of frustative, apprehensive, and evidential morphology, highly complex agglutinative morphology, contrastive nasality on vowels and other prototypically Amazonian phonological features.</p>

			<p>A’ingae is an endangered language thought to have around 2,000 native speakers in Ecuador and Colombia. The national borders are thought to demarcate a linguistic divide: of the two major dialects, one is spoken along the Aguarico River in Ecuador; the other—on the San Miguel, Guamués, and Putumayo rivers in Colombia. As the Cofán population nearly quintupled since the 1960s and A’ingae is still used vigorously, the language is classified as developing. In Ecuador, A’ingae is spoken widely though not universally across registers, by all social groups and in all domains of life, with the attitudes towards the language being positive. In communities with stronger Kichwa and colonial influences, especially in Colombia, the prominence of Spanish and other languages may be more prominent. </p>

			<p>An orthography for the language was first developed by the SIL missionaries Marlytte and Roberta Borman, and more recently revised by members of the Cofán communities, which we follow here. Our team is currently in the process of conducting a sociolinguistic survey to assess the vitality of the language in written and spoken forms across different social settings.</p>
			<h3>The A’ingae Language Documentation Project</h3>

			<p>ALDP came about as a collaboration between Scott AnderBois, a professor at Brown University, and Hugo Lucitante, a native speaker of A’ingae from Zábalo who did his BA at Brown from 2015-2019 (currently a PhD student in Anthropology at the University of Texas at San Antonio). Through thinking about the importance of his language both through his coursework as well as in conversations outside the classroom, Hugo recognized the need for community-engaged language documentation. Together with Wilson Silva, a professor at the University of Arizona, the ALDP was born.</p>
			<p>Our project aims to document the A’ingae language, investigate scientific questions about its grammar and usage, and to promote community capacity building in service of the production of community-oriented materials.</p>

			<p>In addition to being available on this via the Texts tab at the top, primary language materials are also archived at the California Language Archive at UC Berkeley and the <a href="https://elar.soas.ac.uk/Collection/MPI1079687">Endangered Languages Archive</a> at SOAS.</p>

			<p>Scott is an Associate Professor in the Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences (CLPS) at Brown University. His research is focused on issues in semantics and pragmatics, especially those concerning non-truth conditional meanings and the way they interact with sentence type. Beyond A’ingae, his work has explored these issues through primary fieldwork on Yucatec Maya (Mayan, Mexico) and Tagalog (Austronesian, Philippines). Additionally, he co-directs with Miguel Oscar Chan Dzul (Universidad de Oriente) <a href="https://yucatecmaya.github.io/LingView/#/">U koorpusil maaya t'aan</a>, a multipurpose digital corpus of Yucatec Maya.</p>

			<p>Wilson is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona. He is a field linguist with formal training in theoretical linguistics and language documentation & revitalization. Beyond A’ingae, he has conducted research in Desano and Siriano; two endangered Eastern Tukanoan languages spoken in the Vaupés Region of Brazil and Colombia.</p>
